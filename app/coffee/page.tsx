                The beans you brew are actually the processed and roasted seeds from
                a fruit, which is called a coffee cherry. When dried, roasted, and
                ground, it’s used to brew coffee. If the seed isn’t processed, it
                can be planted and grown into a coffee tree.

                Roasting transforms green coffee into the aromatic brown beans that
                we know as coffee. Light roast is heated for a shorter time and at a
                lower temperature than dark roast. Dark roast coffee beans stay in
                the roasting machine for longer and at a higher temperature. Medium
                roasts are somewhere in between.

                Light roasts tend to have more delicate yet complex flavour profiles
                than dark roasts. Dark roasts tend to have deep but simple flavours
                due to some of the initial flavours of the beans being lost or
                changed during the roasting process. Dark roast is sometimes
                described as tasting more bitter than light roast. However, the
                overall flavour of coffee is affected by many factors, such as the
                roasting method, brew method, brewing time, the coffee-to-water
                ratio used, etc.
